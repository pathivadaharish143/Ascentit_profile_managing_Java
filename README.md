                   PROJECT
 (US IT Candidate Data Management & Analytics System)
 
Project Humble :

It is a system designed to streamline and improve the efficiency of IT recruitment processes. With a user-friendly interface, the process of candidate searching and storing data in your company. Currently, employees collect candidate details and documents through LinkedIn and Naukri. However, this data is stored individually, and if an employee leaves the company, the data is lost. To solve this, the project aims to create a centralized database where all employee-gathered data and documents are stored.
When an employee collects candidate data, they must upload it to the company database. Additionally, there is a vendor who provides specific requirements for candidates. Employees can use the company database to search for candidates who match these requirements based on experience and technology skills. When the employee leaves the company, the employee will lose access to the application, but the data will still be in the database, which that the employee has been created. This will be helpful to the company to provide resources to other employees in the future.
For administrative purposes, an admin panel will be created. This panel allows administrators to monitor employee performance. It provides information on how many candidates each employee submitted within a particular date range. Overall, Project Humble aims to streamline candidate recruitment by centralizing data, facilitating efficient candidate searches, and providing managerial insights.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
